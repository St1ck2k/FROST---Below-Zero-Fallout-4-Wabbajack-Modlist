# FROST - Below Zero Fallout 4 Wabbajack Modlist
This is a github repository for a modlist made by following [Below Zero - A FROST Modding Guide](https://redawt.github.io/f4-frost-guide) -  Recommended Setup. 

It also contains a small guide on how to install the modlist, some clarifications about the small changes, requirements, recommended specs, and credits.

The author is not connected to the FROST Development Team, but has the permission to make this modlist.

## Description
FROST is a total conversion mod for Fallout 4. For best experience, FROST requires a number of different mods to supplement it. [Below Zero](https://redawt.github.io/f4-frost-guide) is a list of such mods and a guide on how to properly install them. Wabbajack is a tool used to install mod lists with pre-defined load order and other settings, effectively doing the work of the guides such as Below Zero for you.

The goal of this Wabbajack modlist is to provide a simple way to install a basic FROST modlist in just a few clicks. It was made by following the [Below Zero](https://redawt.github.io/f4-frost-guide) guide (Recommended Setup), from INI settings to applying all needed FROST patches. It doesn't contain anything else besides the mods mentioned in Recommended Setup section, with few exceptions:
- It includes some additional INI tweaks from BethINI, The Midnight Ride, Optimization Guides Collection, and FO4 Step Modifications.
- It installs all FallUI options and therefore includes a generated Complex Sorter patch for FIS - The NEW FallUI Item Sorter.
- It doesn't include Pack Attack NPC (PANPC) mod, because the author doesn't allow its distrubtion through modlists or NexusMods. You can find instructions on how to get it in Below Zero guide itself, in the Imporant Mods section.
- It uses Ultra Interior Lighting and Ultra Exterior Lighting as Lighting Mods options.
- It uses Root Builder to manage files that need to be placed in the Root folder of the game instead of the Data folder, such as F4SE.

[The Midnight Ride Guide](https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/) and its authors - it inspired Below Zero guide, and therefore this modlist. A lot of sections from Below Zero guide are identical to the Midnight Ride Guide. If you are planning to make a non-FROST Fallout 4 setup, you should use The Midnight Ride guide or its [Wabbajack list](https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/wabbajack.html).

[Optimization Guides Collection 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/50005) - the modlist uses some of its INI settings.
