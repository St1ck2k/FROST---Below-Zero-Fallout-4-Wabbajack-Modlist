# FROST - Below Zero Fallout 4 Wabbajack Modlist
This is a github repository for a modlist made by following Below Zero - A FROST Modding Guide -  Recommended Setup.

## Description
The goal of this modlist is to provide a simple way to install a basic FROST modlist in just a few clicks. It was made by following the [Below Zero](https://redawt.github.io/f4-frost-guide) guide, from INI settings to applying all needed FROST patches. It doesn't contain anything else besides the mods mentioned in Recommended Setup section, with few exceptions:
- It includes some additional INI tweaks from BethINI, The Midnight Ride, Optimization Guides Collection, and FO4 Step Modifications.
- It installs all FallUI options and therefore includes a generated Complex Sorter patch for FIS - The NEW FallUI Item Sorter.
- It doesn't include Pack Attack NPC (PANPC) mod, because the author doesn't allow its distrubtion through modlists or NexusMods. You can find instructions on how to get it in Below Zero guide itself, in the Imporant Mods section.
- It uses Ultra Interior Lighting and Ultra Exterior Lighting as Lighting Mods options.
- It uses Root Builder to manage files that need to placed in the root folder of the game instead of Data folder, such as F4SE.
